# Anon-Identity Mobile App Development Plan

## Project Overview
A React Native mobile application for both Android and iOS that manages anonymous identity information using the `anon-identity` npm library. The app will scan QR codes to add identities and store them locally on the device.

## Multi-Phase Action Plan

### Phase 1: Project Foundation
- [ ] Initialize React Native project with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up project structure and basic navigation
- [ ] Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing framework (Jest/React Native Testing Library)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and builds

### Phase 2: Core Identity Management
- [ ] Install and configure anon-identity library
- [ ] Create local storage solution for identity data (AsyncStorage/MMKV)
- [ ] Build basic identity list and detail screens
- [ ] Write unit tests for identity storage functionality

### Phase 3: QR Code Integration
- [ ] Add QR code scanning capability (react-native-vision-camera + ML Kit)
- [ ] Integrate QR scanning with anon-identity library
- [ ] Create QR scanning UI and error handling
- [ ] Write unit tests for QR scanning functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] Implement identity fetching and population using anon-identity
- [ ] Add identity validation and error handling
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Optimize performance and add analytics

### Final Phase: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Update documentation and CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Final testing and deployment preparation

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **State Management**: TBD (Context API or Redux Toolkit)
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage or MMKV
- **QR Scanning**: react-native-vision-camera + ML Kit
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Success Criteria
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)
- Secure local storage of identity data
- Reliable QR code scanning
- Integration with anon-identity library
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
